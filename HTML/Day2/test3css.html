                     Over the years there have been many copies
                    of Coppercoat. As can been from this picture, the
                     performance is NOT the same! This test panel has 
                     been in the River Dart for 20 months. In case you
                      hadn’t guessed, Coppercoat® is on the left!

                    <div> We received this picture and comments from
                        Poole Sea Safari this morning. This Parker RIB is very

                          the Coppercoat is performing. When the owner first
                           applied Coppercoat, he noticed a marked increase in
                            performance and a decrease in fuel consumption.
