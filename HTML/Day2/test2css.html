                Knox-Johnston on the Coppercoat stand on Wednesday, 
                who was interested in celebrating with us how pleased
                 he is with the Coppercoat applications currently taking
                  place on the fleet of Clipper 68 ft racing yachts. To 
                  keep up to date with the current Clipper Race
