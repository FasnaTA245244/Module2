        <p id="p-1" class="p1 first-para">CSS selectors <span>define the pattern</span> to select elements to which a set of CSS rules are then applied.
            CSS selectors can be grouped into the following categories based on the type of elements they can select.</p>

        <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
        <p id="p-2" class="p1">JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class
             functions. While it is most<span> well-known as the scripting language </span>for Web pages, many non-browser environments
             also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
            single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional 
            programming) styles.</p>

        <h1>Introduction to Selectors</h1>
        <p id="p-3" class="p1">This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages
            or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs 
            and DOM. The standards for JavaScript are the <span>ECMAScript Language Specification </span>(ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript
            Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to 
            document it.</p>
